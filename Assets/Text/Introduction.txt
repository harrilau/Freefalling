You're a part of the Clan of Ducks. The village's food and water supply is running dangerously low and the closest neighbouring village is much too far for any of the villagers. The closest oasis is too far as well. You, the young and sprightly duckling that you are, volunteer to take an adventure to find the grand otherworldly being. (Use Enter to continue.)
The grand otherworldly being is able to grant one's wish but it seems like it depends on their mood. To be honest, you're not quite sure how you're going to convince them. The journey there is going to be pretty dangerous and long so you'll have time to think about it later. 
Should it grant you a wish, the village had decided that an oasis close by your village would be the best thing to wish for. From the water, they could stave off thirst and could grow their own crops.
The time to leave draws near. Your family wishes you the best of luck and for your safe return. You read somewhere that holding a power pose builds confidence. 
So there you are, holding a power pose for a couple of minutes before setting off. Deep breaths, ducky, deep breaths.
