What's a baby like you doing here-- Wait a second.
QUACK! (YOU'RE A DUCK TOO! I HAVEN'T SEEN ANOTHER DUCK IN AGES. HOW ARE YOU? WHO ARE YOU? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?)
Quack. (Oops. Sorry. I got excited.)
Quack? (Well if you're not much a talker, great! I love talking. TALKING GETS ME SO EXCI-- there I go again.)
Quack! (Anyways! It's pretty cold and slippery around here. It's pretty different compared to the Scorching Sands. Welcome to Icicles. Creative name, right?)
Quaaa. (You go ahead, I'll be right HERE WHEN YOU FALL.. I mean IF you fall.. Heh.)

QUACK. (A LITTLE BIRDIE TOLD ME--)
The bigger duck takes a deep breath.
Quack! (You must be freezing your timbits off with how short your feathers are.)
Quack. (Wait, that's not what the little birdie told me.)
Quack! (Something something don't miss it something something!)
Quack. (Heheh. I forgot. Good luck!)

QUACK! (YOU'RE BETTER AT THIS THAN I THOUGHT!)
QUACK!! (THIS IS A GREAT REASON TO BE EXCITED!)
QUACK. (SOUNDS LIKE I DIDN'T NEED TO PRETEND I FORGOT.. errr..)
Quack! (You did great! Haha.. ha... Please don't look at me.)

Quack. (Alright. Your final trial. The last run. La fin.)
QUACK! (HAHAHA JUST KIDDING. Well, kind of. You're almost across the Icicles! Hmm maybe I should call it something different. It's a little bit misleading. What do you think of Frosty? YOUR EYES TELL ME 'LIKE THE SNOWMAN?'! Heck yeah like the snowman!)
Quack. (... Maybe we'll just stick with Icicles for now.)

QUACK! (I'M GOING TO MISS YOU SO MUCH YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND.)
QUACK.. (I REFUSE TO CALM DOWN THIS IS A MOMENTOUS MOMENT FOR YOU.)
QUACK (THAT WAS A DIFFICULT LAST JAUNT THROUGH THE ICICLES BUT YOU MADE IT!)
Quack!! (Good luck!! I hope you'll always remember me like I'll always remember you!)
