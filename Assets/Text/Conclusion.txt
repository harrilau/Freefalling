You've reached the grand otherwordly being who took the form of a corgi. However, you were surprised the other animals you encountered on the way were also otherwordly beings looking out for you. Especially the squirrel. It didn't seem particularly welcoming but it still taught you well. 
Corgi, which is how it addressed itself, was happy to grant your wish to create an enchanted oasis next your village. Given how you proved your worth and virtue to the group of otherworldly beings, they believed that the Clan of the Ducks deserved peace and a propserous future, especially if they had other ducklings like you.
The oasis would last for an eternity so the ducks would never need to worry about drought ever again. The otherworldly beings also promised you that they'd visit every once in while. Even the squirrel promised too.
Upon returning back to your village, a celebration is launched by your fellow villagers. From that day forth, the younger ducklings were told stories of your adventures and would soon grow up to be exemplary ducks.
The end.
