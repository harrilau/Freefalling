Hey, kid! It's been a little while but we've been watching you. Not in the creepy 'I watch you sleep' watching but the boss told us to.
I'm real proud you made it this far and remembered what I taught you! Guess that makes me a pretty good teacher, huh?
Anyways, keep going! I'm sure the others wanna congratulate you.

The squirrel looks a bit less apprehensive to see you.
Good job.

QUACK!! (YOU DID IT! YOU REMEMBER ME RIGHT? ... OH GOOD I CAN TELL FROM THE LOOK IN YOUR EYES. Wait is that a look of exasperation?)
QUACK! (NO WAY, YOU'RE TOO NICE FOR THAT! Even though you've never said anything to me. YOU'RE PRETTY NICE IF YOU SIT THROUGH ALL MY BABBLING.)
Quack! (Congratulations, quackie from another quacker! I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOU TO MEET THE BOSS. HE'S SUPER NICE JUST LIKE YOU!)

Flawless perrforrmance. We have no qualms with letting you talk to ourr superriorr.

Hello, child of ducks. You had a ruff time on your way up here but you made it! Who woofld've guessed that you had such a strong passion for your mission?
Heh, alright enough of that.
I know all about your village and your subsequent quest to seek out our aid.
Did you pass our test? Can you truly say you've demonstrated courage and confidence, calmness and calculation, rhythm and quick thinking as well as patience and perserverance?
Absolutely, yes! You've put on quite the show for us and we're all extremely proud. Every fall. Every setback. Every success. Every triumph.
The corgi starts wagging his tail.
I'd be humbled to grant you your wish. Let's begin by taking the transporter one last time.
You take a deep breath and brace yourself.. This is it. Your adventure. It's coming to a close.
