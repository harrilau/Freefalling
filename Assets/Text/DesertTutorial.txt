Hey kid, haven't seen you around here before. What'cha doing?
... Hey kid, stranger danger is real and all but you can talk back!
... Alright I get it, you're more of a listener. First tip: don't walk off edges! You'll magically vanish and appear back at the beginning of this level, whatever that means.
Alrighty, get moving (WASD or arrow keys) and jumping (Spacebar)! We'll talk more later.

Great job, kid! You're a natural! This funky looking cloud with a star transports you to the next level. Congratulations on finishing your first level!
To use the transporter, use either the (Up Arrow) or the (W) key!

Fancy meeting you here :^). Anyways, watch out!
See those darker blocks? They're quicksand. If you're frolicking on quicksand for too long, you'll go kablooey!
You'll be able to get through this, I know you can. I'll see you later!

Hmm that next jump looks a little impossible, doesn't it? If you look real closely at the floor, you may see some buttons!
I've.. err I mean someone.. has cleverly disguised them as grass pieces. Step on them to see what happens!

Amazing job, kid! I'm real proud of you. This is where we'll be parting ways so you better remember what I've told you.
I'm sure you can do this, kid. I can see the determination in your eyes. The reason for this journey must be of the utmost importance.
Seeya, kid!
