Oh. A child.
Should I help them? Should I impede their journey?
You. Take a leap of faith down.

Take notice of the corrupted grass ahead. You'll move slower and cannot jump quite as high.
Avoid making risky jumps while standing on them.

Good luck.

Colour me impressed. I'll be honest, I didn't think you'd make it so far.
... Why are you still here? You've passed this trial. Onwards.
